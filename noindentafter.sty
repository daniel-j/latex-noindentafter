%  We only need |etoolbox|. The definitions below can probably
%  be rewritten not to need it, but for me it has not been
%  worth the effort. Due to the modification of implemtentation, 
%  |etoolbox| is absolutely necessary
%  (\url{https://github.com/mhelvens/latex-noindentafter/pull/1}).
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{etoolbox}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  \noindent The package |etoolbox| provides the command
%  |\AfterEndEnvironment| which crates a hook executed at 
%  a very late point by the |\end| command. However, this 
%  hook is invoked before |\ignorespaces|, which is too early 
%  to suppress the indention after an environment. Therefore 
%  another hook to |\end| is added with |\patchcmd| after 
%  |\ignorespaces|. This new hook is executed last at the end 
%  of an environment.

%  \noindent This is the main part of this package. The command
%  |\@NoIndentAfter| checks, if it's followed by an paragraph.
%  In this case, the command |\par| is temporarily changed, so 
%  that the following paragraph is not indented. Therefore, 
%  |\everypar| is used. After that, the default behavior is 
%  restored with |\@restorepar|.
